SYMARFIMA: a dynamical model for conditionally symmetric time series with long range dependence mean structure.
we introduce a dynamical model for conditionally symmetric
time series accommodating a long range dependent structure for the conditional mean.
More specifically, the proposed model specify the underlying distribution of the time
series, conditionally to its past, to be symmetric. The conditional mean is specified to
accommodate a long range dependent structure, following an ARFIMA-like design,
as well as a (possibly time dependent) set of regressors.
